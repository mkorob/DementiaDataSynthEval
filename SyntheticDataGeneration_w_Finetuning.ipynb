I just wanted to say Shame on the Royal Mail – I think that’s what you call them, the people that you put the stamps on and post things – I’ve just paid twenty pounds and – d’you know? They were overcharging, I’m sure they were. I wasn’t there, someone had to go to the post office with me, but because one of the large Christmas cards wouldn’t go through the special thing, they charged me two pounds twenty – well, it’s ridiculous what they’re charging and when it was all sorted it cost me seventeen pound ninety-nine to post a few things through the post and I really think the Government should be challenging the Royal Mail and saying to them, in this time, when we can’t get out when we’ve no choice except for to post our small gifts, our token gifts and cards off to people as a minder – shame on them! That’s all I’ve got to say. They re raking it in and it will be a long time before I guess there s mail anything someone should open'"

Good Morning, This is Laura. Welcome to the Before Breakfast podcast. Today's tip is that when you are scheduling things, communicate when you are currently available and when that might change. That way, : you aren't stuck holding more time than you need to or no longer available when someone finally confirms so. I have always found it a bit unfortunate when people request lots of slots of availability as an please list the times you are available next week. I mean, what is : one supposed to do with that? If it's a meeting with your most important client, I mean, of course you want to give them options. Same befo're talking about a job interview, had a place where you are dying to work. But for most run of the mill stuff, giving people half a dozen multi hour options and then having them : not come back to you immediately is going to result in schedule chaos. That's because schedules are dynamic. If someone asks today you may be available any morning next week but three days from now you will probably not be available any morning\",\n          \"Hi everybody, it\\u2019s Agnes from Coatbridge calling.

It\\u2019s very strange, but what was the strangest and most perplexing thing was, I saw that most of the shops are open, some never opened because they\\u2019re closed because of financial things, betting shops are open and we have quite a few in our local community, pubs are open and we have quite a few of them as well, but the one thing that\\u2019s not open at all is our local library! Now, I rely heavily on my library and I\\u2019ve got a bag of books here that I\\u2019m concerned about, because I haven\\u2019t been able to take them back since the beginning of March. What\\u2019s happening here? There\\u2019s just a big notice saying CLOSED! No information, no nothing, no means of depositing your old books, no sign of life!
